# Project RadiusEdge: Summary of Changes & Next Steps (as of 2024-06-03)

This document summarizes the significant feature enhancements, UI improvements, and backend foundational work (primarily API routes and database schema) implemented in the RadiusEdge prototype during our recent interactions. It also provides guidance for transitioning to a live, operational system.

**IMPORTANT NOTE ON LIVE BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION:**
A detailed guide titled "RadiusEdge: Next Steps for Live Backend Implementation" was provided in a previous interaction. That guide contains comprehensive instructions, considerations for technology choices, security best practices, and an iterative development plan for building the real SSH, RADIUS, SQL, and API execution capabilities. **Please refer to that previous detailed guide for the full "A to Z documentation" on completing the project.** This summary will highlight changes made to the prototype.

## I. Backend and Data Persistence

### 1. SQLite Database Integration
*   **Description:** Implemented a local SQLite database (`radiusedge.db`) for persistent storage of all application data.
*   **Key Files Modified:**
    *   `src/lib/db.ts`: Contains database connection logic, schema definition, and initialization. The schema includes tables for scenarios, packets, server configurations, DB configurations, users, test results, test executions, execution logs, AI interactions, and dictionaries.
    *   All API route handlers in `src/app/api/` were updated to interact with this SQLite database for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on their respective data entities.
    *   Page components in `src/app/` (e.g., `scenarios/page.tsx`, `packets/page.tsx`, etc.) were updated to fetch data from and save data to these API endpoints.

## II. Core Feature Enhancements

### 1. AI Assistant (`src/app/ai-assistant/page.tsx`)
*   **AI Interaction History:** The page now fetches and displays a history of AI interactions (packet generation, attribute explanation) from the database.
*   **Database Storage:** Interactions are saved to the `ai_interactions` table via `POST /api/ai-interactions`.
*   **Key Files Modified:**
    *   `src/app/ai-assistant/page.tsx`
    *   `src/app/api/ai-interactions/route.ts`

### 2. Dictionaries Manager (`src/app/dictionaries/page.tsx`)
*   **Content Import & AI Parsing:**
    *   Users can import dictionary metadata by manual entry, pasting raw dictionary file content, or uploading dictionary files.
    *   Pasted/uploaded content is sent to an AI flow (`parseDictionaryFileContent`) to attempt parsing of VENDOR, ATTRIBUTE, and VALUE lines. Parsed attributes are stored as "exampleAttributes".
    *   **AI Flow:** `src/ai/flows/parse-dictionary-file-content.ts`
*   **Example Attribute Management:** Users can view and manually manage (add/edit/delete) the example attributes associated with each dictionary metadata entry.
*   **Bulk Actions:** Implemented bulk enable/disable and delete for selected dictionaries.
*   **Database Storage:** Dictionary metadata and their example attributes (as JSON) are stored in the `dictionaries` table.
*   **Key Files Modified:**
    *   `src/app/dictionaries/page.tsx`
    *   `src/app/api/dictionaries/route.ts`
    *   `src/app/api/dictionaries/[id]/route.ts`
    *   `src/ai/flows/parse-dictionary-file-content.ts`
    *   `src/ai/dev.ts` (to include the new flow)

### 3. Packet Editor (`src/app/packets/page.tsx`)
*   **Attribute Name Suggestions:** When typing an attribute name, suggestions are dynamically fetched from active dictionaries via a new API endpoint. Search is case-insensitive.
    *   **New API Endpoint:** `GET /api/dictionaries/attributes/search`
*   **`radclient` / `radtest` Tool Selection & Options:**
    *   UI added to select either `radclient` or `radtest` as the execution tool for a packet.
    *   Conditionally rendered forms allow configuration of all relevant command-line options for the selected tool (e.g., target server, secret, count, retries, auth type, debug flags, etc.).
    *   **Data Structure:** `RadiusPacket` interface updated with `executionTool` and `toolOptions`.
    *   **Database Schema:** `packets` table updated with `executionTool TEXT` and `toolOptions TEXT` (JSON string) columns.
*   **Key Files Modified:**
    *   `src/app/packets/page.tsx` (major UI and logic changes)
    *   `src/app/api/packets/route.ts`
    *   `src/app/api/packets/[id]/route.ts`
    *   `src/app/api/dictionaries/attributes/search/route.ts`
    *   `src/lib/db.ts` (schema update for `packets` table)

### 4. Scenario Builder (`src/app/scenarios/page.tsx`)
*   **Dynamic Packet Templates:** The "Packet Template" dropdown within a RADIUS step now dynamically fetches and lists actual packets from the Packet Library (database) instead of using hardcoded samples.
*   **AI Attribute Parsing:** The "Parse from Text" feature for expected reply attributes in RADIUS steps uses the `parseRadiusAttributesFromString` AI flow.
    *   **AI Flow:** `src/ai/flows/parse-radius-attributes-flow.ts`
*   **Key Files Modified:**
    *   `src/app/scenarios/page.tsx`

### 5. Execution Console (`src/app/execute/page.tsx`)
*   **Log Persistence:** Test execution records (`test_executions` table) and detailed logs (`execution_logs` table) are now saved to the database.
*   **Improved UI & Log Display:**
    *   GUI rearranged for better user-friendliness and a more professional look.
    *   Enhanced visual distinction for different log types (INFO, ERROR, SENT, RECV, SSH_CMD, SSH_OUT, SSH_FAIL).
    *   SSH command logs are formatted to resemble a command prompt (e.g., `user@host:~$ command`).
*   **Enhanced Simulation:**
    *   Logs now simulate the choice of `radclient` or `radtest` and some of their key options when "sending" a packet.
    *   **Simulated SSH Preamble:** The console simulates the execution of SSH preamble steps defined in the target `ServerConfig`'s `scenarioExecutionSshCommands`.
*   **Log Export:** Functionality added to export the displayed logs to a plain text file.
*   **Key Files Modified:**
    *   `src/app/execute/page.tsx` (significant UI and simulation logic updates)
    *   `src/app/api/executions/route.ts` & `src/app/api/executions/[id]/route.ts`
    *   `src/app/api/logs/route.ts` & `src/app/api/logs/[testExecutionId]/route.ts`
    *   `src/lib/db.ts` (schema for `test_executions` and `execution_logs`)

### 6. Settings - Server & Database Configuration
*   **Server Configuration (`src/app/settings/servers/page.tsx`):**
    *   **Server Type:** Updated to 'freeradius', 'radiusd', or 'custom' (with a field for custom type name).
    *   **Connection Test SSH Preamble:** Added UI and data model to define SSH preamble steps that are (simulated) executed *before* the main connection test sequence. This is distinct from the scenario execution SSH preamble.
    *   **AI Flow Update:** `test-server-connection-flow.ts` updated to accept and simulate these new connection test preambles.
*   **Database Validation Setup (`src/app/settings/database/page.tsx`):**
    *   **Direct Test SSH Preamble:** Added UI and data model to define SSH preamble steps that are (simulated) executed *before* the DB connection attempt and validation sequence during a "Test Connection & Validation".
    *   **AI Flow Update:** `test-db-validation-flow.ts` updated to accept and simulate these new direct test preambles.
*   **Key Files Modified:**
    *   `src/app/settings/servers/page.tsx`
    *   `src/app/settings/database/page.tsx`
    *   `src/app/api/settings/servers/route.ts` & `src/app/api/settings/servers/[id]/route.ts`
    *   `src/app/api/settings/database/route.ts` & `src/app/api/settings/database/[id]/route.ts`
    *   `src/lib/db.ts` (schema updates for `server_configs` and `db_configs` tables)
    *   `src/ai/flows/test-server-connection-flow.ts`
    *   `src/ai/flows/test-db-validation-flow.ts`

## III. UI/UX and Bug Fixes

*   **Sidebar Horizontal Scroll Fix (`src/app/layout.tsx`):**
    *   Added `min-w-0` to the main content flex container to prevent the fixed sidebar from scrolling horizontally with wide page content.
*   **Radix UI Accessibility Fixes (`src/components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx`):**
    *   Addressed console errors related to `DialogTitle` requirements for `Sheet` components by correctly conditionally rendering `SheetTitle` only in mobile view.
*   **Missing `mssql` Package (`package.json`):**
    *   Added `mssql` to dependencies to resolve "Module not found" errors during build/runtime, as it was imported in `src/lib/services/db-service.ts`.

## IV. Notes on SSH and Live Operations (Current Prototype State)

*   **Simulation Only:** All SSH operations, RADIUS packet sending, external SQL queries, and API calls within the application (both for "Test Connection" features and "Scenario Execution") are currently **simulated**.
    *   The AI flows (`test-server-connection-flow.ts`, `test-db-validation-flow.ts`) use a mock `sshService` and `dbService` to produce realistic-looking log output.
    *   The `ExecutionConsolePage` (`src/app/execute/page.tsx`) simulates SSH preambles and packet exchange based on mock data or simple logic.
*   **Configuration for Live Systems:**
    *   The UI for defining Server Configurations (`scenarioExecutionSshCommands`, `connectionTestSshPreamble`) and Database Configurations (`directTestSshPreamble`, `sshPreambleSteps`) allows you to specify real SSH commands and sequences. **These configurations are stored in the database and are ready to be used by a real backend engine.**
    *   The Packet Editor allows detailed configuration of `radclient` and `radtest` options, also stored for future use by a real backend.
*   **Impact on Your Local SSH Work:**
    *   The changes I made related to SSH are primarily:
        1.  **Defining SSH Steps in UI:** Adding sections in Server Config and DB Config pages for users to *input* SSH command sequences for various preambles. This should not conflict with your local work, as it's about data definition.
        2.  **Updating AI Flows for Simulation:** The AI flows that *simulate* "Test Connection" for servers and databases were modified to *also simulate* these newly defined SSH preamble steps. These flows use `sshService.executeCommand()`, which is a *mocked service* in `src/lib/services/ssh-service.ts`. If your local SSH implementation replaces or modifies `src/lib/services/ssh-service.ts` or the AI flows directly, you will need to integrate your live SSH logic there.
        3.  **Updating Execution Console Simulation:** The `src/app/execute/page.tsx` was updated to *simulate* the `scenarioExecutionSshCommands` from the server configuration. This is purely frontend simulation for display.
    *   **No Live SSH Code Added by Me:** I have not introduced any code that attempts to make *actual* SSH connections from the Next.js application or its API routes. The `ssh-service.ts` provided is a mock.
    *   **Your Path Forward:** When you build your backend execution engine, it will be responsible for fetching these stored SSH command configurations and executing them using a real SSH library.

This summary should help you reconcile the changes made to the prototype with your local development efforts. Remember to consult the detailed "Next Steps for Live Backend Implementation" guide for a full roadmap.
